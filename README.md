# Library Management System in Python

This is a simple **Library Management System** implemented using **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** in Python. It allows users (students) to borrow and return books, view available books, and track borrowed books.

## Features

- View list of available books
- Borrow books by student name
- Return books by student name
- Track who borrowed which book
- Prevents unauthorized returns
- Case-insensitive book matching

## Technologies Used

- Python 3
- OOP (Classes and Objects)
- Command-line interface (CLI)

## How It Works

1. **Display Books** – Shows available books with a count.
2. **Borrow a Book** – Asks for student name and book name, then processes borrowing if available.
3. **Return a Book** – Student can return a borrowed book using their name.
4. **Show Borrowed Books** – Displays all currently borrowed books along with student names.

2. Navigate to the project directory:
